## Full-Stack Todo App

This is a full-stack Todo app that includes a frontend built with HTML, CSS, JS, and TypeScript, as well as a backend written in Go. The Go backend is designed to handle functions.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains all the static files for the frontend (HTML, CSS, JS, and TypeScript).
- `main.go`: The entry point for the Go application if you're running it locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Go server locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend compilation if using TypeScript)

### Install Go

If you haven't installed Go yet, follow the instructions on the official website:

- [Go Installation](https://golang.org/doc/install)

### Install Node.js

 TypeScript is used in  frontend, so  need to install  Node.js to compile it into JavaScript.
